## Class Activity

We learned how to put an audio source to assets so that it give out sounds. We were advised to not use the doppler setting because it will mess with the sound and we used linear rolloff in the 3d sound setting. And if we set the maximum range of the audio source to a specific number, we can hear it less and less or not hear it at all.

## Progress

I added some waves sounds to my environment to give it a more realistic and more sense of place. It really gives off the vibe that we are actually on a cliffside with the ocean surrounding it. For the Different zones, i added some sad and slow music for the first zone and added calm and enlightening classical music for the second one. I added the sound source for the music to the terrain because i just want both of the environment to have background music.

I finally made the second zone, i added a different skybox and put in the glowing tree. I think it really fits the aesthetic of the environment. And for the objects that were in the first zone, i replaced it with a ship to symbolise navigating through life and i also place some books to symbolise the pursuit of a higher education.

I also added the huge structure that symbolises growth, i decided that it should be a giant tree. Luckily i found the best asset for the job and i love how it turned out and how it fits so well in my environment.
