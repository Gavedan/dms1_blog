## Wayfinding Activity
![e2](e2.jpg)

This Activity showed us that paying attention to the signifiers will help a lot in navigating something. And from this activity, i learned that i should consider intergrating this in my environment.

## Progress

From what we learned from class today, i decided on a couple of things:

1. The Entrance : First, i decided that the entrance for my environment should just be in an open sort of alley in the island, because i plan to put fog in my environment so that it gives off a more mysterious and uncertain feeling.
2. The Path : for the path i plan to make it a more straight path by making the island have sort of rough edges that make it so that there's only one way to go.
3. Thresholds : and for the thresholds, like what i mentioned in the previous blog post, i will be adding a huge gate that serves as an entrance to a new dimension of some sort.
4. Landmarks : i think just like the map that i drew in the last blog post, i will add the lighthouse as a landmark as it will always be in the environment in both zones.

This is the base terrain that i have edited for my environment. I think i really like how it turned out, becuase i think it looks like a semi realistic cliffside environment. I imported a bridge from sketchfab and i added some cubes to the bottom of the bridges to act as a support pylon/legs.
