## Class Activity
![e3](e3.png)

We did a small little exercise in class to learn how to create perspective in Unity. We were given an image and we need to recreate it in Unity for about 30 minutes. This is a pretty interesting exercise, becuase this teaches us how to set up things so that it gives it more depth and shows more perspective.

## Progress
1. ![z](z.png)

I added a skybox and painted textures on the terrain. I also imported a lighthouse that looks somewhat similiar as to what im going for. For the Cliff textures, i used multiple layers to convey more realism to the cliff because some of the layers give the texture more life.

To add more Depth to my environment, i added some fog. This also creates a more cold and sad ambience to the environment. Overall pretty satisfied on how it looks by adding in the fog.

Added the old tree to the island, overall the look of the tree is acceptable. It looks a bit too low resolution for my environment but still looks ok because of the dark lighting.

4. ![z](z3.png)

Added water to my environment, i watched some youtube tutorials on how to do it. Overall looks pretty good and satisfied with the water. Also imported objects to the water.
