Today i learned the basics of adobe illustrator and we also had a fun little activity, this activity helps us think more creatively. It really got my brain to work to its fullest.

The first concept that i had an idea for is Dream.
    For dream i have 2 ideas, the first one is childhood dreams type of icons, these icons would be used in googlde chrome for a a charity campaign for the less fortunate children. The second one is Dreamy things, what i meant by dreamy things is like stars. This idea is intended to be in google chrome for a sleep help website icons and it's for all ages to consumje.
The next concept that i chose is Future.
    For future i only have 1 idea, it is for an apocalypse type of icon and its for google chrome for a game. These icons would be used as the game ui and the target audience is people over the age of 13 and targeted to gamers.
The last concept i chose is System.
    For system, i have an idea for a star constelations/star signs for an icon, it's going to be used in google chrome for a game marketing campaign. The target audience for this icons are for all ages and targeted to specifically gamers.
