## MY STORYBOARD

The key point of my two minute video is the last sequence of my video, it turns back to the streets and shows that the street light has turned green. This symbolizes that me as a person is fine with the everyday monotone life that i live.

I'm going to support the emotional tone of the video by using diegetic sounds from the surroundings of some of the scenes and on some scenes i will use some classical/melancholic music to further elevate the emotion of the scene.

## QnA

  - What is the emotional tone of the broader portrait, and how are your editing choices going to support that tone generally?

    The emotional tone of the broader portrait is somewhat melancholic but it turns somewhat hopeful towards the end. My edtiting choices will support the tone by having some timed jump cuts and transitions.

  - What does the audience need to understand about the relationship between shots in this moment? What connection are you trying to forge?

     The audience need to understand that the shots that are included in the video, is an accurate represantation of what i am. I feel like the shots that i will take, generally will reflect on what i am as a person. The connection that i am trying to forge is that, i am trying to convey what type of person i truly am to the audience.

  - What sort of rhythm, tempo, or pace are you attempting to establish during this moment? How will your editing produce this?
    
    The sort of rythm that i am attempting is going to follow the rythm of a street lights clicking sound when you cross the street. But for the majority of the video, it will change into a more slowed down rythm but will still follow that same rythmic sound of the street light. I will produce this by cutting the video precisely timed with the clicking sound
