## First Icon
For the first icon, i chose the third colourway. This is because the yellow on his hair highlights the blue and it makes the color more pop and vibrant.
## Second Icon
For the second icon, i chose the third colourway. This is because the colours more express the emotion that i'm going for in the icon, so i chose a more analogous colourway.
## Third Icon
For the third icon, i chose the third one. I chose the third one because i like how the pink and its gradients are looking together that's why i chose this colourway.
## Fourth Icon
For the foruth icon, i chose the third colourway. This is because i want this one to be simple, not too loud and not too complex. That's why i chose a more monotonous colour palette
