# SCAVANGER HUNT
## An Exploding Coffee

This is something that we thought somewhat resemble an exploding coffee. Although we didn't quite get the right object, we still had a good laugh about the coffee machine that we took a picture with.

## A Study Fit for A Sith Lord

We found this object because one of us had been there, so it was sort of easy to figure out when he saw it on the checklist.

## A Wide Net Strung Above, Bulging Under The Weight of Its Flying Paper Cargo

We found this thing by coincidence, we were going down the escalator and i spotted something by the window. It looked like it matched the description so we took a picture with it, we're pretty sure it's right.


## A Book Containing Digital Media Wisdom, Found Amongst Many

We didn't have enough time to find the book so we rushed to the library and found something resembling digital media. Although we didn't quite get it right, we at least still tried to get the book while having five minutes left


## A door for the condemned

We asked around the campus to see if anyone knew something similar to the description. That's when one of us remembered, that there is a building that's based around a prison. So we headed straight there and took a picture with something resembling a jail cell.



## A curtain of roots, delivered by a winged visitor

We were out of ideas at this point, we were short on time too. We were running out of Building 6 and that's when we stumbled upon a wall covered in roots by coincidence.

## The disembodied hands of a great ape

We were looking around Bowen Street and that's when we found a huge pair of hands belonging to a great ape. That totally fits the description, so we took a picture straight away.

## A basement-dwelling Black Box, bigger than you might think

After finding the star wars room, we were figuring out what does the black box mean. We instantly started to think about a building that has a basement in it. The only building that has a basement is building 6, so we went straight there and took a picture in front of the recording studio.

## A wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land.

This is the first thing that we took off the checklist. Because it is pretty self explanatory what it was.

## A golden globe atop a tower of eights.

Sadly, we didn't have enough time to find this object.
