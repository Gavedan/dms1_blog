## CLASS ACTIVITY

The most effective one is the first icon sketch, because it shows all the necessary things and it doesn't go over board with the design.

## ICON SKETCHES

The first 30 sketches are all the same theme, because the icons that i will be making (star constelations) have animal type things in them. Thats why i think that the third sketch of these icons would be the best for the assignment.

The last 15 sketches are still similiar, but i think i will add some parts of each sketch to the final icons. Because, this will help further elevate the icons so that it looks more interesting.
