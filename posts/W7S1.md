## Environment Title: "Isle of Departure"

I chose this title because i took inspiration from changes in my life. The change that happened is that i moved away from my home country to study abroad here in Australia. This change is somewhat nerve racking because i have never lived far away from my parents. It forces me to be more responsible towards myself and also to learn and grow up from this experience. The Enviroment will feature a couple of things related to my departure, and the meaning behind this environment is that even though it might seem scary and sad to face this change in my life, it will be an unforgettable experience ( build new connections, face different challenges and etc ).

### Key Zones/Areas:
#### Zone 1

This will represent my feelings and emotions before coming to study here in Australia. It will feature a more of a dark and gloomy tone because i was feeling really anxious and nervouse before coming here. I will use a night skybox as it will be foggy and dark.

1. Departure Isle:
   - Design: This area represents the last moments in your old life. It's a semi-realistic rendering of a nostalgic space with things that represents the things that defined my chilhood/past. It will have a Lighthouse that represents some sort of guidence in my departure/change, so that we don't lose our way. The old tree represents the feeling of being scared of the challenges that i will face and how i might not be able to grow up. The arcade game machine just represent my love for gaming and my pc back at home :). I also will put a group of mannequins to represent my friends and family.
   - Ambiance: a chilly and sort of empty feeling, with nostalgic childlike sounds.

2. The Bridge of Reflection:
   - Design: A metaphorical bridge that spans between the old life and onto the new. This bridge is built over the Ocean of the Past as it connects the Departure Isle and The Gate of Opportunities together.
   - The player will walk through a bridge that crosses an ocean filled with remnants of my past. The player can also look back to the first area to see a representation of my family and friends.

3. The Ocean of The Past:
   - Design : An ocean that has remnants of my past, as it represents im walking away and moving away from my past life. There will be a building that represents my school, a plane that represents the flight that took me here, a computer monitor that represents playing games with my highschool friends after school.

4. The Gate:
   - Design: On the far side of the bridge lies a huge overlooming gate that is shrouded with fog that brings the player to a new place. The Gate will be surrounded by mountains/cliffs as it will look more mysterious.

#### Zone 2
This zone represents my feelings after living here for 3 months. It will show that even though i'm here alone, doesn't mean that everything that i left behind will disappear, and i will build new and meaningfull connections here too as it will help me grow as a person. I will use a more warm and bright skybox for this zone.

5. The Other Dimension :
   - **Design:** A similiar replica to the first zone, but it will feature different things. The old tree is replaced by a glowing pink tree that represents the feeling of being more courageous and a sense of reponsibility to grow up. The mannequins will also be placed inside the island as it represents that my loved ones won't leave me just because i moved away and i will always be connected to them. There will also feature a new thing behind the gate, and it will be a huge structure that represents growth that i have experienced here and also the connections that i made here.
   - **Ambiance:** The area is filled with calm and soothing music as the waves of the ocean crash through the rocks.

### Visual and Aesthetic Considerations:
- Lighting: Use shifting light to reflect the emotional state of the player. cold and gloomy, nostalgic tones in the beginning, transitioning to warmer, more colourful shades as they move forward.
- Sound Design: Implement soundscapes that revolves around each zone, from nostalgic echoes to foreign, unfamiliar tunes, providing emotional cues for each stage of the journey.
