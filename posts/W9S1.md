## Class Activity

Today we learned how to build and record our environments, we also made surveys for our playtesters and see their feedback on the environment.

## Progress

This is gameplay from one of my playtesters, Grant.

From this question, i can see that most of the playtesters find the environment convey change relatively nicely

From what i can see, the problem that i need to fix in my environment is the mouse sensitivity and the environment being too empty. So, i made some changes to the mouse sensitivity so that players can look around more easily. And to solve the feeling of the environment being too empty, i added some footsteps everytime the player move so it feels more realistic.

this is the code i used to make the player create footsteps everytime they move.

The third question tells me that the environment pretty much shows what i wanted to convey to the playtesters.

I touched on this already in question too.

I think the playtesters enjoyed the ambience and the background noise of the environment
