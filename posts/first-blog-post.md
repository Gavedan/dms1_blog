# SCAVANGER HUNT
## An Exploding Coffee

This is something that we thought somewhat resemble an exploding coffee. Although we didn't quite get the right object, we still had a good laugh about the coffee machine that we took a picture with.

## A Study Fit for A Sith Lord

We found this object because one of us had been there, so it was sort of easy to figure out when he saw it on the checklist.

## A Wide Net Strung Above, Bulging Under The Weight of Its Flying Paper Cargo

We found this thing by coincidence, we were going down the escalator and i spotted something by the window. It looked like it matched the description so we took a picture with it, we're pretty sure it's right.


## A Book Containing Digital Media Wisdom, Found Amongst Many

We didn't have enough time to find the book so we rushed to the library and found something resembling digital media. Although we didn't quite get it right, we at least still tried to get the book while having five minutes left


## A door for the condemned

We asked around the campus to see if anyone knew something similar to the description. That's when one of us remembered, that there is a building that's based around a prison. So we headed straight there and took a picture with something resembling a jail cell.



## A curtain of roots, delivered by a winged visitor

We were out of ideas at this point, we were short on time too. We were running out of Building 6 and that's when we stumbled upon a wall covered in roots by coincidence.

## The disembodied hands of a great ape
![image seven](photo5.JPG)

We were looking around Bowen Street and that's when we found a huge pair of hands belonging to a great ape. That totally fits the description, so we took a picture straight away.

## A basement-dwelling Black Box, bigger than you might think
![image eight](photo11.JPG)

After finding the star wars room, we were figuring out what does the black box mean. We instantly started to think about a building that has a basement in it. The only building that has a basement is building 6, so we went straight there and took a picture in front of the recording studio.

## A wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land.
![image nine](photo6.JPG)

This is the first thing that we took off the checklist. Because it is pretty self explanatory what it was.

## A golden globe atop a tower of eights.

Sadly, we didn't have enough time to find this object.

## MY STORYBOARD

![storyboard 3](S3.JPG)
![storyboard 4](S4.JPG)

The key point of my two minute video is the last sequence of my video, it turns back to the streets and shows that the street light has turned green. This symbolizes that me as a person is fine with the everyday monotone life that i live.

I'm going to support the emotional tone of the video by using diegetic sounds from the surroundings of some of the scenes and on some scenes i will use some classical/melancholic music to further elevate the emotion of the scene.

  - What is the emotional tone of the broader portrait, and how are your editing choices going to support that tone generally?

    The emotional tone of the broader portrait is somewhat melancholic but it turns somewhat hopeful towards the end. My edtiting choices will support the tone by having some timed jump cuts and transitions.

  - What does the audience need to understand about the relationship between shots in this moment? What connection are you trying to forge?

     The audience need to understand that the shots that are included in the video, is an accurate represantation of what i am. I feel like the shots that i will take, generally will reflect on what i am as a person. The connection that i am trying to forge is that, i am trying to convey what type of person i truly am to the audience.

  - What sort of rhythm, tempo, or pace are you attempting to establish during this moment? How will your editing produce this?
    
    The sort of rythm that i am attempting is going to follow the rythm of a street lights clicking sound when you cross the street. But for the majority of the video, it will change into a more slowed down rythm but will still follow that same rythmic sound of the street light. I will produce this by cutting the video precisely timed with the clicking sound
